## Contributing

Pull Requests from our design, development and operations teams of [Haufe.Group](http://www.haufe-lexware.com) and its subsidiaries are greatly appreciated. If you've never contributed to an open source project before we are more than happy to walk you through how to create a pull request. 

The short version of it is to fork this repo into (a) a repo of your own account under (b) the name `[your_account_name].github.io`. Upon your first commit the blog should be published at `http://[your_account_name].github.io`. In this way you can add your changes and test them live. When you are finished create a pull request with your changes and submit it against our blog repo.

Support for Categories and Tags were inspired by [this blog entry](http://www.minddust.com/post/tags-and-categories-on-github-pages/). A list of the defined categories and tags can be found at `_data/categories.yml` and `_data\tags.yml` respectively. If you want to add new categories or tags, you need to add them to the corresponding `.yml` file and add the matching template into the `meta/category` or `meta/tag` directories. Please do not go overboard with adding new categories and tags but try to stay within the ones we have. On the other hand - if you feel strongly about adding one, feel free to submit a pull request.

Author support was inspired by [this blog entry](https://blog.sorryapp.com/blogging-with-jekyll/2014/02/06/adding-authors-to-your-jekyll-site.html). In order to add information on a new author, edit the `_data/authors.yml` file, then use the new key as `author` link in the posts. If an author cannot be found in `authors.yml`, the content of the `author` tag will be used verbose. In that case, no links to any social media (Twitter, Github and LinkedIn are currently supported) will be included.

If you want to find out more about using `github-pages` for blogging or want to improve our blog the following links might be good starting points:
